I am Mingi Jeong, and I would like to be an enthusiastic, devoted expert in Computer Science (__Robotics__) and __Ocean Engineering__ who will contribute to global society. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate of the Department of Computer Science at __Dartmouth College__, USA. I am a member of [Dartmouth Reality and Robotics Lab](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/home/) and am working with [Prof. Quattrini Li](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/albertoq/). __TODO_MM and previous

By utilizing my professional background and skill-set obtained from a fulfilling __Chief Mate__ position on board, I hope to be a dedicated researcher in the autonomous navigation area by developing cutting-edge technologies, and being equipped with outstanding knowledge through interdisciplinary research.

__Research interest__:
* Autonomous navigation
* Aquatic Robot
* Obstacle detection and tracking
* Obstacle avoidance
* Motion planning
* Decision-making
* Multi-robot system
* Environmental monitoring
* Optimized design and building

I am mainly focuses on marine autonomy by surface vehicles. I study design platform, situational awareness, and obstacle avoidance algorithms of robotic boats through __interdisciplinary research__ to contribute to safe and efficient autonomous navigation in real-world environments.
