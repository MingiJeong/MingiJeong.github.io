I am Mingi Jeong, and I would like to be an enthusiastic, devoted expert in Computer Science (Robotics) and Ocean Engineering who will contribute to global society. I am a Ph.D. candidate of the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth College. I am a member of [Dartmouth Reality and Robotics Lab](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/home/) and am working with [Prof. Quattrini Li](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/albertoq/). 

By utilizing my professional background and skill-set obtained from a fulfilling Chief Mate position on board, I hope to be a dedicated researcher in the autonomous navigation area by developing cutting-edge technologies, and being equipped with outstanding knowledge through interdisciplinary research.
