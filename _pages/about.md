I am Mingi Jeong, and I would like to be an enthusiastic, devoted expert in __Computer Science (Robotics)__, __Artificial Intelligence__ and __Ocean Engineering__ who will contribute to global society. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate of the Department of Computer Science at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/), USA. I am a member of [Reality and Robotics Lab](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/home/) and am working with [Prof. Alberto Quattrini Li](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/albertoq/). Before that, I served on ocean-going commercial vessels (LNG tanker, container vessel) for 5 years as a __Chief Officer__ (final rank) in [Hyundai Merchant Marine Co.,Ltd.](http://www.hmm21.com/cms/company/engn/index.jsp) under the connected service with the Korean Navy. I received a B.S in Nautical Science and a M.E in Maritime Safety Engineering from [Korea Maritime and Ocean University](https://www.kmou.ac.kr/english/main.do), working with [Prof. Eunbang Lee](https://www.kmou.ac.kr/mp/cm/cntnts/cntntsView.do?mi=2062&cntntsId=701). During a cadet period, I was an exchange student and Indoctrination Officer (IDO) in [SUNY Maritime College](https://www.sunymaritime.edu/) as the U.S. Coast Guard licensing regimental system, fully sponsored by [Rotary International](https://www.rotary.org/en)'s Ambassadorial scholar.


By utilizing my professional background and skill-set obtained from a fulfilling Chief Mate position on board, I hope to be a dedicated researcher in the __autonomous navigation__ area by developing cutting-edge technologies, and being equipped with outstanding knowledge through __interdisciplinary research__.

<!-- I am mainly focuses on marine autonomy by surface vehicles. I study design platform, situational awareness, and obstacle avoidance algorithms of robotic boats through __interdisciplinary research__ to contribute to safe and efficient autonomous navigation in real-world environments.  -->

<h2><b>Research Interest </b></h2>

How can we create ***persistent and robust robot decision-making systems*** capable of functioning in ***complex, unstructured environments*** where intelligent systems can have a profound societal impact in areas such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue, and cargo or passenger transportation? 

I am passionate about investigating:
* Aquatic Robot
* Full stack autonomy
* Autonomous navigation
* Obstacle detection and tracking
* Obstacle avoidance
* Topological planning
* Intention-aware collision avoidance, Learning-augmented planner
* Multi-criteria decision-making, Pareto-optimality
* Multi-robot system
* Environmental monitoring
* Optimized design and building
