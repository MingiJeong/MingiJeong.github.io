  abstract={There are many applications where an autonomous agent can perform many sets of actions. 
  It must choose one set based on some behavioral constraints on the agent. Past work has used a deontic logic based framework to declaratively express such constraints in logic, 
  and developed the concept of a feasible status set (FSS), a set of actions that satisfy these constraints. However, multiple FSSs may exist and  an agent needs to choose one in order to act. 
  As there may be many different ways of evaluating status sets, we propose the concept of Pareto-optimal feasible status sets or POSS.  We show that the problem of checking if a status set is a POSS is co-NP-hard. 
  We develop an algorithm to find a POSS. In the special case when the objective functions are monotonic (or anti-monotonic), we develop more efficient algorithms to compute a POSS. Finally, we run experiments to show the efficacy of our approach and we discuss possible ways to handle multiple Pareto-optimal Status Sets.}

  volume={},

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel decision-making framework for planning ``when'' and ``where'' to deploy robots based on prior data with the goal of persistently monitoring a spatio-temporal phenomenon in an environment. 
  We specifically focus on large lake monitoring, where remote sensors, such as satellites, can provide a snapshot of the target phenomenon at regular cycles. 
  Between these cycles, Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) can be deployed to maintain an up-to-date model of the phenomenon. 
  However, deploying ASVs has a significant logistical overhead in terms of time and cost. It requires a team of people to go on site and spend typically a day to monitor the deployment. 
  It is vital to not only be intentional about where to sample in the environment on a given day, but also determine the worth of deploying the ASVs that day at all.
Therefore, we propose a persistent monitoring strategy that provides the days and locations of when and where to sample with the robots by leveraging Gaussian Process model estimates of future trends based on collected remote sensing and point measurement data.
Our approach minimizes the number of days and locations for sampling, while preserving the quality of estimates. 
Through simulation experiments using realistic spatio-temporal datasets, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach over traditional deployment strategies, 
including significant savings on the effort and operational cost of deploying the ASVs.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a modification of the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter to compute online the probability of detection (PD) and
probability of survival (PS) of targets. This eliminates the need for predetermined and/or constant PD and PS values,
that may degrade the estimation. The proposed filter estimates the PD and PS values for each individual target based on
newly introduced parameters, which are updated during the measurement update process. The effectiveness of the proposed
filter was validated through an in-lab experiment using four unmanned ground robots with varying PD values and a realworld lidar-based obstacle tracking system implemented on
an Automated Surface Vehicle operating in a lake with realtime boat traffic. The results of the experiments demonstrate
that the proposed filter outperforms the standard PHD filter with incorrect PD and PS values. These findings highlight the
potential benefits of the proposed filter in improving target tracking performance in complex environments.},

  abstract={Navigation and obstacle avoidance in aquatic environments for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in high-traffic maritime scenarios is still an open challenge, as the Convention  on  the  International  Regulations  for Preventing  Collisions  at  Sea (COLREGs) is not defined for multi-encounter situations. Current state-of-the-art methods resolve single-to-single encounters with sequential actions and assume that other obstacles follow COLREGs. Our work proposes a novel real-time non-myopic obstacle avoidance method, allowing an ASV that has only partial knowledge of the surroundings within the sensor radius to navigate in high-traffic maritime scenarios. Specifically, we achieve a holistic view of the feasible ASV action space able to avoid deadlock scenarios, by proposing (1) a clustering method based on motion attributes of other obstacles, (2) a geometric framework for identifying the feasible action space, and (3) a multi-objective optimization to determine the best action. Theoretical analysis and extensive realistic experiments in simulation considering real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate that our proposed real-time obstacle avoidance method is able to achieve safer trajectories than other state-of-the-art methods and that is robust to uncertainty present in the current information available to the ASV. },

  abstract={Identifying in-water obstacles is fundamental for safe navigation of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs). This paper presents a model-free method for segmenting individual in-water objects (e.g., swimmers, buoys, boats) and shorelines from LiDAR sensor data. To reduce the computational requirement, our method first converts the 3D point cloud into a 2D spherical projection image. Then, an algorithm based on the integration of a breadth-first search and a variant of a hierarchical agglomerative clustering segments the points according to different objects. Our method addresses the sparsity and instability of the point cloud in the aquatic domain – a characteristic that makes the methods developed for self-driving cars not directly applicable for in-water obstacle segmentation, as demonstrated in our experiments. Our method is compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and is validated both in simulation and in real-world ASV deployments, with different objects and encountering scenarios. The proposed method is effective in segmenting in-water obstacles not known a priori, in real-time, outperforming other state-of-the art methods.},

The proposed method uses the sensor readings about the pose of the other obstacles to infer their motion model (velocity and heading) and, accordingly, adapt the risk assessment and take corrective actions if necessary. Relative vector calculations allow the method to perform in real-time. The algorithm has 1.68 times faster computation performance with less change of motion than other methods and it enables a robot to avoid 25 obstacles in a congested area. Fallback behaviors are also proposed in case of faulty sensors or situation changes. Simulation experiments with parameters inferred from experiments in the ocean with our custom-made robotic boat show the flexibility and adaptability of the proposed method to many obstacles present in the environment.

We propose a multi-criteria route planning technique for operators to objectively determine the routes according to their intentions. In this study, the navigational traffic risk of a route is quantitatively assessed using a model of a ship. Then, a risk contour map is visualized by structuring the data as absolute danger, hazard factors, and influential factors, which is a framework for route planning. Finally, a multi-criteria route could be modeled by considering the safety, efficiency, convenience, and ability of navigation as the main criteria. The technique assesses each criterion by analyzing the cumulative risk per distance, distance, number of waypoints, and risk gradient of derived routes. In addition, the technique proposes routes by utilizing its algorithm and incorporating contour-based projection and reference points. To verify the proposed technique, we carried out numerical simulations and evaluated actual AIS data. The results show that this technique can not only suggest goal-oriented routes but also assess the used routes. Therefore, the proposed technique can improve the route planning method to be more systematic, which contributes both to smart navigation based on the user's purposes and to future autonomous navigation.}

To prevent maritime traffic accidents involving ships carrying HNS, this study proposes an intuitive route risk assessment technique using risk contours that can be visually and quantitatively analyzed. The proposed technique offers continuous information based on quantified values. It determines and structures route risk factors classified as absolute danger, absolute factors, and influential factors within the assessment area. The route risk is assessed in accordance with the proposed algorithmic procedures by means of contour maps overlaid on electronic charts for visualization. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed route risk assessment technique, experimental case studies under various conditions were conducted to compare results obtained by the proposed technique to actual route plans used by five representative companies operating the model ship carrying HNS. This technique is beneficial not only for assessing the route risk of ships carrying HNS, but also for identifying better route options such as recommended routes and enhancing navigation safety. Furthermore, this technique can be used to develop optimized route plans for current maritime conditions in addition to future autonomous navigation application.}
