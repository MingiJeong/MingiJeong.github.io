  title={Efficient LiDAR-based In-water Obstacle Detection and Segmentation by Autonomous Surface Vehicles in Aquatic Environments}, 
  abstract={Identifying in-water obstacles is fundamental for safe navigation of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs). This paper presents a model-free method for segmenting individual in-water objects (e.g., swimmers, buoys, boats) and shorelines from LiDAR sensor data. To reduce the computational requirement, our method first converts the 3D point cloud into a 2D spherical projection image. Then, an algorithm based on the integration of a breadth-first search and a variant of a hierarchical agglomerative clustering segments the points according to different objects. Our method addresses the sparsity and instability of the point cloud in the aquatic domain â€“ a characteristic that makes the methods developed for self-driving cars not directly applicable for in-water obstacle segmentation, as demonstrated in our experiments. Our method is compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and is validated both in simulation and in real-world ASV deployments, with different objects and encountering scenarios. The proposed method is effective in segmenting in-water obstacles not known a priori, in real-time, outperforming other state-of-the art methods.},

  title={Risk Vector-based Near miss Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Surface Vehicles},
  abstract={This paper presents a novel risk vector-based near miss prediction and obstacle avoidance method. The proposed method uses the sensor readings about the pose of the other obstacles to infer their motion model (velocity and heading) and, accordingly, adapt the risk assessment and take corrective actions if necessary. Relative vector calculations allow the method to perform in real-time. The algorithm has 1.68 times faster computation performance with less change of motion than other methods and it enables a robot to avoid 25 obstacles in a congested area. Fallback behaviors are also proposed in case of faulty sensors or situation changes. Simulation experiments with parameters inferred from experiments in the ocean with our custom-made robotic boat show the flexibility and adaptability of the proposed method to many obstacles present in the environment. Results highlight more efficient trajectories and comparable safety as other state-of-the-art methods, as well as robustness to failures.},

All prototype designs are thoroughly tested using hydrostatic analyses, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, and real-world field testings. Quantitative metrics, including trim, pitch, velocity magnitude of flow, and turbulence, are used to compare different configurations. Our experiments show that a motor configuration at the back part of the straights hulls is the most optimal design, resulting in high-quality data collection.},

  abstract={Assessment of risk during ship navigation is essential to safe maritime transportation. This paper proposes a novel real-time method, specifically tailored for a human operator onboard a ship, to attain situational awareness of multiple static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed method is based on risk vectors to encode the direction and the probability of collision represented by a bivariate Gaussian distribution, which allows the operator to visualize the risk in a more effective way than conventional scalar methods. We implemented a proof-of-concept in MATLAB and performed some numerical experiments with different configurations - e.g., type and number of obstacles, direction of encountering - showing real-time visualization that can help operators to take more informed decisions, as well as the cumulative risk of a path.},

  abstract = {Route planning in maritime transportation is the key to safe, efficient, and smart navigation. We propose a multi-criteria route planning technique for operators to objectively determine the routes according to their intentions. In this study, the navigational traffic risk of a route is quantitatively assessed using a model of a ship. Then, a risk contour map is visualized by structuring the data as absolute danger, hazard factors, and influential factors, which is a framework for route planning. Finally, a multi-criteria route could be modeled by considering the safety, efficiency, convenience, and ability of navigation as the main criteria. The technique assesses each criterion by analyzing the cumulative risk per distance, distance, number of waypoints, and risk gradient of derived routes. In addition, the technique proposes routes by utilizing its algorithm and incorporating contour-based projection and reference points. To verify the proposed technique, we carried out numerical simulations and evaluated actual AIS data. The results show that this technique can not only suggest goal-oriented routes but also assess the used routes. Therefore, the proposed technique can improve the route planning method to be more systematic, which contributes both to smart navigation based on the user's purposes and to future autonomous navigation.}

  abstract={Despite the development of safety measures and improvements in preventive systems technologies, maritime traffic accidents that involve ships carrying hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) continuously occur owing to increased amount of HNS goods transported and the growing number of HNS fleet. To prevent maritime traffic accidents involving ships carrying HNS, this study proposes an intuitive route risk assessment technique using risk contours that can be visually and quantitatively analyzed. The proposed technique offers continuous information based on quantified values. It determines and structures route risk factors classified as absolute danger, absolute factors, and influential factors within the assessment area. The route risk is assessed in accordance with the proposed algorithmic procedures by means of contour maps overlaid on electronic charts for visualization. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed route risk assessment technique, experimental case studies under various conditions were conducted to compare results obtained by the proposed technique to actual route plans used by five representative companies operating the model ship carrying HNS. This technique is beneficial not only for assessing the route risk of ships carrying HNS, but also for identifying better route options such as recommended routes and enhancing navigation safety. Furthermore, this technique can be used to develop optimized route plans for current maritime conditions in addition to future autonomous navigation application.}

It is designed to quantify the risk of a vessel carrying HNS with a matrix method along navigational route and indicate hazards distribution with a contour map. The basic system which provides a visualized degree of hazards in real time has been introduced for the safe navigation of HNS ships. This is useful not only for decision making and circumstantial judgment but may also be utilized for HNS safety management with a risk base. Moreover, this system could be extended to address the navigational safety of marine traffic as well as of autonomous vessels in the near future if the sensors used are connected with IoT technology.}
