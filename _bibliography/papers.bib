  title={Efficient LiDAR-based In-water Obstacle Detection and Segmentation by Autonomous Surface Vehicles in Aquatic Environments}, 
  abstract={Identifying in-water obstacles is fundamental for safe navigation of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs). This paper presents a model-free method for segmenting individual in-water objects (e.g., swimmers, buoys, boats) and shorelines from LiDAR sensor data. To reduce the computational requirement, our method first converts the 3D point cloud into a 2D spherical projection image. Then, an algorithm based on the integration of a breadth-first search and a variant of a hierarchical agglomerative clustering segments the points according to different objects. Our method addresses the sparsity and instability of the point cloud in the aquatic domain – a characteristic that makes the methods developed for self-driving cars not directly applicable for in-water obstacle segmentation, as demonstrated in our experiments. Our method is compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and is validated both in simulation and in real-world ASV deployments, with different objects and encountering scenarios. The proposed method is effective in segmenting in-water obstacles not known a priori, in real-time, outperforming other state-of-the art methods.},

  title={Risk Vector-based Near miss Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Surface Vehicles},
  abstract={This paper presents a novel risk vector-based near miss prediction and obstacle avoidance method. The proposed method uses the sensor readings about the pose of the other obstacles to infer their motion model (velocity and heading) and, accordingly, adapt the risk assessment and take corrective actions if necessary. Relative vector calculations allow the method to perform in real-time. The algorithm has 1.68 times faster computation performance with less change of motion than other methods and it enables a robot to avoid 25 obstacles in a congested area. Fallback behaviors are also proposed in case of faulty sensors or situation changes. Simulation experiments with parameters inferred from experiments in the ocean with our custom-made robotic boat show the flexibility and adaptability of the proposed method to many obstacles present in the environment. Results highlight more efficient trajectories and comparable safety as other state-of-the-art methods, as well as robustness to failures.},

  abstract={This paper presents an optimized design of research-oriented ASVs and a systematic design evaluation methodology for reliable in-water sensing. The objective is to minimize the interference on sensor readings by any ASV maneuver. The design space includes motors and sensors locations. In addition, this paper analyzes modularity - i.e., the effects of new sensor's installation. All prototype designs are thoroughly tested using hydrostatic analyses, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, and real-world field testings. Quantitative metrics, including trim, pitch, velocity magnitude of flow, and turbulence, are used to compare different configurations. Our experiments show that a motor configuration at the back part of the straights hulls is the most optimal design, resulting in high-quality data collection.},

  title={A Risk Visualization Technique based on Static and Dynamic Data for Maritime Mobility}, 
  abstract={Assessment of risk during ship navigation is essential to safe maritime transportation. This paper proposes a novel real-time method, specifically tailored for a human operator onboard a ship, to attain situational awareness of multiple static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed method is based on risk vectors to encode the direction and the probability of collision represented by a bivariate Gaussian distribution, which allows the operator to visualize the risk in a more effective way than conventional scalar methods. We implemented a proof-of-concept in MATLAB and performed some numerical experiments with different configurations - e.g., type and number of obstacles, direction of encountering - showing real-time visualization that can help operators to take more informed decisions, as well as the cumulative risk of a path.},

  title={An Adaptive Route Plan Technique with Risk Contour for Autonomous Navigation of Surface Vehicles}, 
  abstract={This study develops a new technique for an adaptive route plan that realizes autonomous navigation by surface vehicles at sea by utilizing real-time data. Prior to the application of the methodology, our technique assesses and visualizes maritime traffic risk as the foundation for the route planning of an Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs). Based on the risk contour map and the ASV's data processing, the algorithm that proposes routes which match the desired objects according to the operator's input, was developed. This methodology was applied and evaluated for verification by planning adaptive routes and analyzing maritime traffic accidents as case studies. The results demonstrate that the technique is useful as it enables an ASV to quantitatively and automatically adapt its route to fit the real-time situation, and for applications to be further broadened to diverse areas.},
