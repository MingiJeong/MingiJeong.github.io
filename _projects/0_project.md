```
This paper enhances the obstacle avoidance of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) 
for safe navigation in high-traffic waters with an active state estimation of 
obstacle's passing intention and reducing its uncertainty. 

Our main contributions are:
(a) topological modeling of passing based on maritime navigation's 
inherent conceptual topolog and implementation of LSTM-backbone-based intention classification
(b) a novel multi-objective local planner that includes an active strategy 
to increase information gain in uncertain encounters about the passing intention 
of obstacles, while ensuring collision avoidance; and
(c) implementation in Robot Operating System (ROS) with comprehensive analysis 
through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, experiments in the ocean with a real ASV, 
and a real-world accident case study successfully demonstrating safe and real-time collision avoidance.
