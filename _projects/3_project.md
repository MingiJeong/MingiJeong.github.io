```
This paper presents a novel risk vector-based near miss
prediction and obstacle avoidance that can be used for
computing an efficient, dynamic, and robust action in
real-time. Simulation experiments with parameters inferred
from experiments in the ocean with our custom-made robotic
boat show flexibility and adaptability to many obstacles
present in the environment.
